# English Only Rule

All code, comments, documentation, variable names, commit messages, and any other written content in this repository must be in English.  
This ensures consistency, improves collaboration, and makes the project accessible to a wider audience.

- Do not use other languages (e.g., Russian) in code, comments, or documentation.
- If you find non-English text, please refactor it to English as soon as possible.
- This rule applies to all files, including code, markdown, configuration, and documentation.

**Example:**
```python
# Good
# This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Bad
# Эта функция вычисляет сумму двух чисел.
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
